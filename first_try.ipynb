It is named after Aden Abdullah Osman Daar, the first President of Somalia, and was originally a modest-sized airport. Over the post-independence period, the facility underwent several renovation projects to expand its size and infrastructure. After the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, flight services at Aden Adde Airport experienced routine disruptions, but with the improvement in security in Mog Somali in the late 2010s and 2011, large-scale rehabilitation of the grounds' infrastructure and services resumed. By 2013, the airport had restored most of its facilities and introduced new features.\n",
